The codes are used for the simulations in paper 'Xia G, Xiao P, Li B, et al. Joint beamforming and compressed sensing for uplink grant-free access[J]. IEEE trans. wireless commun. early access, 2024'.
Note that 1) the angles saved in angle.mat are used for simulating the channel gains and are not required to be known a priori; one can change the system parameters to test different simulation setups.
Recommend using the HPC due to the large number of independent trials required to visualize the low user detection rate.
